  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="muted">Last updated: YYYY-MM-DD</p>

  <h2>1. Controller</h2>
  <p>This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>SevenSeasons</strong> ("we", "us", "our") collects, uses and shares information when you use the web application <strong>Community AR Experience / CrowdLens</strong> hosted at <a href="https://sevenseasons.xyz">https://sevenseasons.xyz</a> (the "Service"). Contact: <a href="mailto:support@sevenseasons.xyz">support@sevenseasons.xyz</a>.</p>

  <h2>2. Data we access and why</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Camera access:</strong> We request access to your device camera solely to provide real-time AR previews and to capture photos/videos when you choose to do so. Camera frames are processed in-browser whenever possible.</li>
    <li><strong>Microphone:</strong> Not used by default. If microphone is used in a future feature, we will disclose it here and request permission at runtime.</li>
    <li><strong>Device & browser info:</strong> We may collect non-identifying device/browser information for compatibility and debugging.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. How we use data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Live camera frames are used to render AR effects in real time. By default we <strong>do not</strong> persist or store continuous camera streams on our servers.</li>
    <li>Photos or short videos are only uploaded to our servers if you explicitly click "Upload", "Submit for display", or another similarly-labeled action and provide consent. Uploaded content is used only for the purposes you consented to (e.g., moderation, temporary display on venue screens) and for debugging as described below.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Third parties</h2>
  <p>We use <strong>Snap’s Camera Kit</strong> to provide AR lenses and effects. The Camera Kit SDK may communicate with Snap's services as required by the SDK. We do not sell personal data to third parties. Any minimal SDK calls to Snap are governed by Snap's own policies; we remain the controller of user-uploaded content for the purposes described here.</p>

  <h2>5. Venue / display & consent model</h2>
  <p>When deployed in venues (e.g., stadiums), any content displayed on public venue screens will only be taken from users who explicitly opt in via an in-app consent checkbox at the time of submission. Opt-in submissions go through an automated filter and a human moderation step before being approved for public display.</p>

  <h2>6. Retention and deletion</h2>
  <p>Uploaded items that are submitted for moderation/display are retained for up to <strong>7 days</strong> for moderation and display purposes, unless otherwise stated. You may request deletion of your uploaded content by contacting <a href="mailto:support@sevenseasons.xyz">support@sevenseasons.xyz</a>. On valid deletion requests we will remove the content from display and from our servers per the retention policy.</p>

  <h2>7. Children</h2>
  <p>The Service is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe we have collected such data, please contact us to delete it.</p>

  <h2>8. Security</h2>
  <p>We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect user data. However, no internet transmission or storage is fully secure — if you have concerns, contact us at <a href="mailto:support@sevenseasons.xyz">support@sevenseasons.xyz</a>.</p>

  <h2>9. Your rights</h2>
  <p>You may contact us to request access to, correction of, or deletion of your uploaded content. For deletion of content used for venue displays, please include details (time, description) so we can identify the item.</p>

  <h2>10. Changes to this policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy. When we do, we will update the "Last updated" date above and post the new policy at this URL.</p>
